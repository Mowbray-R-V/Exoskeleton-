Exoskeleton trajectory tracking using T-motor

-Arduino Code to implement Position Control and Velocity Control in our motor
-Python Code to integrate the CAN Communication with the Motor.
-Control Systems Code, using PID, MPC, and LQR to achieve a trajectory.
- CAN integration code in MATLAB, so we could use the appropriate MATLAB toolboxes
